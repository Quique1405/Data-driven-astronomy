"""
Write a get_features_targets function that splits the training data into input features and their corresponding targets. In our case, the inputs are the 4 colour indices and our targets are the corresponding redshifts.

Your function should return a tuple of:

features: a NumPy array of dimensions m â¨‰ 4, where m is the number of galaxies;
targets: a 1D NumPy array of length m, containing the redshift for each galaxy.
The data argument will be the structured array described on the previous slide. The u flux magnitudes and redshifts can be accessed as a column with data['u'] and data['redshift'].
